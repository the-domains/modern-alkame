# THE MODERN ALKAME NOOTROPIC ASSESSMENT

## 1000+ NOOTROPICS. DISCOVER YOURS.

### With so many products out there claiming to optimize your health and mental function, it can be difficult to determine which ones will actually be effective and suit your individual needs. At Modern AlkaMe, we eliminate the guesswork, saving you time, money and confusion.

### The Nootropic Assessment is a great place to start. This 15-minute questionnaire helps the team at Modern AlkaMe get a clear sense of both your unique brain chemistry and your individual goals. Based on your responses, we then design a personalized, one-of-a-kind Nootropic blend that is tailored to your specific needs.

# OUR MISSION

### Your contribution matters. In today's era, everyone wants to self-quantify and take their health into their own hands. Our mission is to use this trend to change the way research is conducted, using your personal journey towards self-improvement to help us understand how to effectively improve cognition and overall health on a much larger scale.

# OUR WORLD

In today's day and age, our society has entered an extremely health-conscious moment in which we have become completely inundated by products and accessories--- wearable devices, Nootropics, health apps, etc.,--- that are all meant to help us understand, quantify, and ultimately improve our mental and physical health. With all of this new tech and information, we have essentially been able to take issues of health and wellness out of the doctor's office and into our living rooms (or onto our wrists). This is great in many ways, since we now have more advances, applications, data and understanding than ever before. On the other hand, though, it's clear that this is not a perfect system and there are undeniable complications and hiccups.

## WHAT'S MISSING

The biggest problem is figuring out how to fully understand and apply all of the information we're receiving since, at this point, only some of these products and accessories work together and make things clear for the user. For example, there are activity trackers and health apps that allow the consumer to track calorie intake, sleep quality, heart rate, weight and physical activity all in the same place --- and make suggestions based on that data. Similarly, more savvy consumers can take a "DIY" approach, personally taking note of how supplements, stimulants, lifestyle changes, etc., are affecting their health and trying to make changes on their own. However, looking at the bigger picture, it's clear that a lot of this information is still coming from disconnected sources and there is no platform where every part of this puzzle can fit together and be broken down. Thus, it's difficult for the average user to fully understand how to apply the information that they are getting and how to make the most out of all of the products and accessories that are out there. Instead, one is left asking questions like: How do I actually use all of this health and wellness feedback to change and improve my life? How do I understand, apply and integrate all of the information and guidance that I am getting? What do I do with it? 

## OUR SOLUTION

> "The overarching goal of Modern AlkaMe is to provide a platform where digital health data can be stored, standardized and analyzed in order to discover the mechanistic relationship between the dietary and environmental variables in our day-to-day lives that impact our health and psychological well-being."

Modern AlkaMe intends to solve these problems and answer these lingering questions. On a very basic level we're starting with Nootropics, introducing you to the very best options that are out there and helping you figure out which ones should be most effective for you. Essentially, we are giving you a user's manual, showing you where to start and what can--- theoretically--- really help you. On a larger scale---specifically, with our new Nootropic Platform---we look at the bigger picture, working to analyze and provide feedback on how these are actually impacting your health and affecting you in reality. How? We essentially centralize all of your health data--- measurements like heart rate, weight, anxiety, energy levels (or, in other words, all of the information that's coming from your various wearable devices and health apps) and analyze how the Nootropics and other products are really affecting you in this bigger context. We then help you make any necessary changes along the way. As a company, then, we not only guide you to the right products and supplements, we also analyze how they're changing your life on a day-to-day basis and help you get a full, dynamic understanding of how these tools can really work together and change your health for the better. This approach is unique because it integrates all of the fragmented information that consumers are getting from various sources and creates a more complete and accurate depiction of the actual state of their health and the actual progress of their improvements

## OUR FUTURE

Modern AlkaMe will only get better over time. With more time, data, users, and applications integrated, we will become more and more helpful, gaining increasingly accurate information about how all of these health tools are affecting people in real life over time and helping them improve their lives. We'll know what works and what doesn't work in the real world, and the world of health optimization will become a lot smaller and a lot easier to navigate.

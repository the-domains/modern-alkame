# The Starter Kit
![The Starter Kit by Modern AlkaMe](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7a40af49-12a9-470f-b539-148b672602a8.jpg)

## The starter kit is the virst of its kind that introduces software and supplements together in a distinct way.

# Learning How The Starter Kit Works

With so many different types of nootropics sold in so many various combinations, finding the right supplements can be extremely difficult. Pair that with unconfirmed marketing claims and almost no quantifiable or empirical data, and it becomes nearly impossible. We've been there, and we want to change that.

The Modern AlkaMe Starter Kit provides four weeks of the four most popular and effective racetams, a specific subset of nootropics, complemented by our own core blends. Four weeks, four different racetams. Using our proprietary app, you can track each agent's efficacy in your day-to-day life.

This approach not only simplifies the process of choosing nootropics that work best for you, but also gives you hard data and analytics to back it up. No more marketing claims, no biases, and no confusion. Just you, and your optimized, quantified self.

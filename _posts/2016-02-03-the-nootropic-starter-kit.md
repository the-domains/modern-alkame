# The Nootropic Starter Kit

Let's face it, when it comes to Nootropics there are many options available-- not only when it comes to choosing individual Nootropics, but also when deciding which to take together. There is a lot of information currently available on how Nootropics work in general, but we are still in the process of learning about what will work best for you.  That's why we've developed the "Start Kit" service at Modern AlkaMe: you will receive a box of the top Nootropics--and 4 weeks of guidance from the Modern AlkaMe team--  to discover your optimum Nootropic combination in an ideal academic fashion.

# Our Mission

## CREATIVE MINDS AIMING TO IMPROVE THE BRAIN

**Your contribution matters. **

In today's era, everyone wants to self-quantify and take their health into their own hands. Our mission is to use this trend to change the way research is conducted, using your personal journey towards self-improvement to help us understand how to effectively improve cognition and overall health on a much larger scale.

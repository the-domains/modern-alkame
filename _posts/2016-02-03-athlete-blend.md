# Athlete Blend

For athletes to be successful, they need to be at the top of their game both mentally and physically. Unfortunately, most of the supplements and products out there focus solely on the physical aspect-- claiming to help with muscle recovery, speed, etc.-- but the mental is just as important: reaction time, stamina, vigilance, focus, motivation and many other cognitive functions are essential to any top athlete.The Nootropics in our athlete blend have been shown to support both the mental and the physical aspects of athletic health, promoting optimum performance 100% of the time. So no matter your level of competition, the "Athlete" blend has been catered to you.

All Nootropics in the "Athlete" blend are approved by the World Anti-Doping Agency, so you can confidently add all of the following Nootropics to your current supplement regimen.

# Lucid Dreaming Blend

Imagine the best dream you've ever had. Now imagine the ability to control it.

Lucid dreaming-- any dream in which one is aware that one is dreaming-- has many potential benefits and implications: with this kind of awareness, one can theoretically avoid nightmares, enhance creativity, and even use sleep time to brainstorm and work through problems and issues. 

One's ability to exert control over his/her dreams can develop over time, and the use of Nootropics as a means to increase dream vividness is extremely common amongst lucid dreaming veterans. It's worth the try for those looking to explore their subconscious or get the most out of a good night's rest.

* Before we can dream, we need relax and reach just the right level of deep sleep. The combination of the amino acid L-Theanine and the herb Ashwagandha comes highly recommended for this very purpose, since both are commonly used to promote calmness and prevent anxiety \[1\] \[2\].

* The granddaddy of all nootropics is also an all-time lucid dreaming favorite. Everybody dreams differently, but vivid dreams are widely reported with

That makes it the perfect Nootropic for those trying to cope with the stressful hours that entrepreneurs deal with every day.  
* Known as the "Original Nootropic", Piracetam is one of the more well-rounded Racetams. It's great for those who need to stay cognitively flexible and on top of their game \[2\].
